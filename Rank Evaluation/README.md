2- sort queries ranks the queries based on a specified feature 

3- Rank evaluation evaluates the performance of a given query and gives the precision and NDCG

4- total evaluation uses the model and evaluates all queries and put them in a csv file 

5- model usage enhanced uses the model and insertion sort to rank documents 

6- ranking creates machine learning model to rank documents
